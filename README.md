# Mortgage Calculator

This project is a simple mortgage calculator application built with React.js. The app takes user input for home price, down payment, interest rate, and loan term (in years) and calculates the monthly payment for a mortgage.It's a simple project I made after applying for a position with Wells Fargo, and as such I used their brand coloring as inspiration.
